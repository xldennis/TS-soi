# Data Information
</br>
### __Data source__: [Dr. Mike West's lab at Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu/~mw/ts_data_sets.html)
</br>
### __Variable__: Monthly values of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)
</br>
### __Yearly Data__: 1950-1994 (540 monthly observations)

# Time Series Plot
![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1](assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png) 

<font size="3"> 
<p style="line-height:50%">
1. Time series overall seems to be stationary with little bit increasing variance since 1980. </br>
2. The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is the monthly fluctuations of air pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin </br>
3. The consistent negative phase of the SOI represents a below-normal air pressure at Tahiti and above-normal air pressure at Darwin- El NinÌƒo (vice versa for positive value).

# Check Stationary Process
![plot of chunk check stationary](assets/fig/check stationary-1.png) ![plot of chunk check stationary](assets/fig/check stationary-2.png) 

<font size="3"> 
<p style="line-height:50%">

- 1: Both ACF and PACF plots show signs of stationary and suggest us to take a look at AR(p) model. 
- 2: Agmented Dickey-Fuller test also supports my thought. It's stationary at the p-value of 0.01.

# Decomposition Process
![plot of chunk decomposition](assets/fig/decomposition-1.png) 
<font size="4"> 
<p style="line-height:50%">

- 1: Trend seem to be harmonic
- 2: There seems to be a strong pattern of seasonality, but let's find it out.

# Nonlinear Transformation
![plot of chunk boxcox transformation](assets/fig/boxcox transformation-1.png) ![plot of chunk boxcox transformation](assets/fig/boxcox transformation-2.png) 
<font size="4"> 
<p style="line-height:50%">

- 1. Although lambda=1 isn't included in the 95% CI of BoxCox plot, high log liklihood still holds for non-transformation
- 2. There is a significant linear relationship between Ln(mean) and Ln(sd) and the parameter is 1.0 which suggests me not to take transformation (am I correct?)

- Since it's stationary already, let's go further to find if there is <b class="positioning">seasonality</b>^*

# Time Series Plot of Seasonality
![plot of chunk seasonality](assets/fig/seasonality-1.png) ![plot of chunk seasonality](assets/fig/seasonality-2.png) 
<font size="3.5"> 
- no strong seasonal pattern is detected, which doesn't seem to make sense to me!

--- .slide x:6700 y:-270 z:-1500
# Cumulative Periodgram
![plot of chunk cp analysis](assets/fig/cp analysis-1.png) 
<font size="3.5"> 
- 1. It doens't look like white noise
- 2. There is no sudden jump at freq=0.8 which supports my hypothesis of no seasonality
- 3. More variance goes to the low frequencies. 

--- .slide x:6700 y:-270 z:-3000
# Spectral Analysis
![plot of chunk spectral analysis](assets/fig/spectral analysis-1.png) 
<font size="3"> 
<p style="line-height:50%">
- 1. No matter if I detrend the data or not, the periodplot spike at a period of 60 month (5 years). 
- 2. As expected, strong pattern is seen at low frequencies. 
- 3. Still, it's odd not to see any seasonality given this is a climate index monthly data (freq=0.8)

- 1. Since AIC suggests AR(1) and PAIC suggests an MA(1), I decide to take a look at all possibilities of ARIMA models
- 2. It seems that ARIMA(1,0,1) model has the smallest AIC value

- 
- both AR and MA parameters are significant to be included in the model

- 
- 1. The model suggested by algorithms has higher AIC
- 2. Moreover, the $\theta_2$ isn't significant to be in the model.

# Model Forecast

<font size="3"> 
<p style="line-height:50%">
- Using a built-up model to predict 12 month data approaching the future, the graph is good at forecasting the future values of the SOI index.
- It seems that SOI tend to go higher in the future and suggests more balanced climate at nothern Australia.(may need to further read some literature to interpret the data)
